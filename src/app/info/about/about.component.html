          Why We Started
        </h2>
        <div class="space-y-4 text-themed-secondary leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            We started Poems India in <span class="text-themed-accent font-medium">2018</span> because we noticed something: there were good writers scattered across social media who weren't getting the attention their work deserved.
          </p>
          <p>
            People were reading the same few writers they already knew, missing out on voices they'd probably love if they could find them.
          </p>
          <p>
            So we built a place where those writers could share their work and where readers could discover them. Not just poetry—though that's our main focus—but also essays, fiction, book reviews, and writing about films worth talking about.

              Every April, we host our National Poetry Writing Month (NaPoWriMo) challenge, where participants attempt to write a poem each day for the entire month. It's a collaborative effort that fosters creativity, builds writing practice, and connects our community of poets.

            <p>
              We provide daily prompts and themes, and while poems don't need to be literal interpretations, they should relate to the prompt. We curate and publish select poems from submissions, showcasing the incredible creativity of our participants.
